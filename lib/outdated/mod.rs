//! Checking if a target is outdated.
//!
//! This check consists of two parts:
//!
//!  1. [`check_outputs`][outdated::check_outputs]:
//!     Checking the outputs and their logged dependencies.
//!  2. [`check_dependencies`][outdated::check_dependencies]:
//!     Checking the inputs and order-only dependencies.
//!
//! [`is_outdated`][outdated::is_outdated] performs both.
